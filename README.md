# AI Experiments Portfolio

This repository is a collection of hands-on AI/ML experiments and mini-projects, designed to explore modern concepts and frameworks in artificial intelligence.

Each folder in this repo represents a focused experiment or project, complete with code, documentation, and (where applicable) interactive demos.

## Projects

- **hugging_face_transformers/**
  - Experiments with Hugging Face Transformers pipelines across NLP, Computer Vision, and Audio tasks.
  - Includes a Gradio app for interactive testing.
  - [Hugging Face Space Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kajolshah310/Transformers-Pipelines)

*(More projects to be added as I continue this journey â€” RAG, LangChain, MCP, Agentic AI, and more.)*

## Goals

- Strengthen and showcase applied AI/ML skills.
- Build an open portfolio of projects that explore state-of-the-art AI concepts.
- Contribute to the open-source AI ecosystem.
